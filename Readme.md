## 📊 Data Structure

The project works with three essential data files in the `data/` directory:

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 teamMembers.json</strong> - Player Database (47 players)</summary>

```json
{
  "teamMembers": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Tom" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Dan" },
    { "id": 3, "name": "Sarah" },
    // ... 44 more players
  ]
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🥅 goalies.json</strong> - Goalkeeper Database (10 goalies)</summary>

```json
{
  "goalies": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Jack" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Mike" },
    // ... 8 more goalies
  ]
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📈 rawData.tsv</strong> - Historical Team Compositions</summary>

```tsv
2	8	10	19	24	9
1	3	17	30	39	5
4	12	23	31	45	7
```

**Format:** Each line = `Player1 Player2 Player3 Player4 Player5 Goalie`
- First 5 numbers: Field player IDs
- Last number: Goalkeeper ID
</details>

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### 🔄 Step 1: Convert Raw Data
Transform your historical TSV data into structured JSON format:

```bash
npm run convert
```

**Output:** `data/transformedResults.json` - Historical teams with player names

---

### 📊 Step 2: Statistical Analysis
Run frequency-based statistical prediction:

```bash
npm run predict
```

**Output:** `data/analysisResults.json` containing:
- 📈 Player frequency statistics
- 🥅 Goalie frequency statistics
- 🤝 Common player combinations
- 🎯 Statistically predicted next team

---

### 🧠 Step 3: AI Prediction
Unleash the power of neural networks:

```bash
# Full AI prediction (train + predict)
npm run predict-ai

# Train model only
npm run train-ai

# Retrain from scratch
npm run retrain-ai

# Predict using existing model
npm run predict-ai-only
```

**Output:** `data/aiPrediction.json` containing:
- 🤖 AI-predicted team composition
- ⏰ Prediction timestamp
- 🔬 Method description
- 📊 Confidence scores
- 📈 Accuracy analysis

## 🔬 How The Magic Works

### 📊 Statistical Engine (`src/teamAnalyzer.js`)

The statistical approach uses tried-and-true frequency analysis:

- **📈 Frequency Analysis:** Counts how often each player and goalie appears
- **🤝 Combination Detection:** Identifies which players work well together
- **🎯 Probability-Based Prediction:** Selects the most statistically likely lineup

### 🧠 AI Neural Network Engine (`src/aiPredictor.js`)

The AI engine employs sophisticated machine learning techniques:

#### 🔮 **1. Player Embeddings**
- Creates **32-dimensional vector representations** of each player
- Captures hidden relationships and team chemistry
- Based on co-occurrence patterns in historical data

#### 🔍 **2. Sequence Pattern Recognition**
- Analyzes sequences of 5 consecutive team compositions
- Identifies temporal patterns and trends
- Learns from team evolution over time

#### 📐 **3. Similarity Metrics**
- Uses **cosine similarity** in high-dimensional embedding space
- Finds historically similar team compositions
- Weights predictions based on similarity scores

#### ⚖️ **4. Multi-Signal Fusion**
Combines multiple prediction signals:
- 📊 Historical frequency data
- 🔄 Recent team composition patterns
- 🎯 Team similarity scores
- 🤝 Player chemistry indicators

#### 🎲 **5. Confidence Scoring**
- Provides confidence metrics for each prediction
- Analyzes prediction consistency across multiple runs
- Offers transparency into model certainty
